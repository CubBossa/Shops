shops:

  #You can add multiple keys to one action by seperating them with a comma (RIGHT_CLICK,LEFT_CLICK).
  #All possible keybindings are:

  # You can define a default template that will automatically be the default template for each new shop.
  # Every shop can have an individual default template, this template will only apply to *new* shops.
  # To set a default template you have to mess with their UUIDs (it's the only thing that is individual for each template).
  # The preset templates that come with the plugin itself are formatted like so:
  # "000000000-0000-0000-00000-000000000000<index>". Of course, if the index has more than one digit you have to remove the
  # according leading zeros.

  # Gray baseline + previous page:           00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002
  # Gray baseline + next page:               00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000003
  # Gray baseline + previous & next page:    00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000004
